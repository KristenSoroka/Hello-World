# Hello, World!

This is my first repo.  

My goal is to become a Frontend Developer in 2021.  To accomplish this goal I have been studying html, css, and javascript using 
Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career path.  Learning and understanding git and github is a step towards my goal.  

At the time this repo was first created I was following along to freecodecamp.org's Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course
